Of Methods and Madness (OMAM): A Spatial History Approach to the Civil War’s Guerilla Violence by Andrew Failka puts the Civil War’s gruesome Guerilla violence on display in a micro setting in Missouri. Failka and his team include plenty of data, maps, and as well as the description of how each source was collected. The OMAM is a perfect blend of digital humanities work. It is definitely a fantastic melting pot.

The best part of this is how Failka presents his data. Failka and his team are not overbearing and each subsection OMAM shows data, pictures/maps, and very detailed data description. I would have liked to see more color throughout the project. It is mainly black, white, and grey with the following added colors of pictures and maps that provide a slight change of theme every now and then. I think more color with the entirety would make for a better curb side appeal when students immediately open the project.

When you first click the URL to the website, you are shown a page with a general OMAM logo with the start of an introduction paragraph on the left side of the screen. If you take a closer look, you are shown twelve tab dots with a home and down arrow button. As you highlight over each tab, it gives you the title of each topic so you can skip to it immediately if you’d like. At the home button on the left, it also gives you the option to skip to some of the topics towards the end of the project. This would include Data, Methods, Credits, and the Interactive Map. I do like the way this is put together because it makes for easier navigation from each topic.
