Of Methods and Madness (OMAM): A Spatial History Approach to the Civil War’s Guerilla Violence by Andrew Failka puts the Civil War’s gruesome Guerilla violence on display in a micro setting in Missouri. Failka and his team include plenty of data, maps, and as well as the description of how each source was collected. The OMAM is a perfect blend of digital humanities work. It is definitely a fantastic melting pot.

The best part of this is how Failka presents his data. Failka and his team are not overbearing and each subsection OMAM shows data, pictures/maps, and very detailed data description. I would have liked to see more color throughout the project. It is mainly black, white, and grey with the following added colors of pictures and maps that provide a slight change of theme every now and then. I think more color with the entirety would make for a better curb side appeal when students immediately open the project.

When you first click the URL to the website, you are shown a page with a general OMAM logo with the start of an introduction paragraph on the left side of the screen. If you take a closer look, you are shown twelve tab dots with a home and down arrow button. As you highlight over each tab, it gives you the title of each topic so you can skip to it immediately if you’d like. At the home button on the left, it also gives you the option to skip to some of the topics towards the end of the project. This would include Data, Methods, Credits, and the Interactive Map. I do like the way this is put together because it makes for easier navigation from each topic.

Included towards the end of the project, after the credits and publications tab. There is a YouTube video Of Methods and Madness (OMAM) with instructions on how to exactly navigate the interactive map. This is a much-needed addition to the project, because it definitely saves students & professors time when delving deeper into the map. The video is roughly 15 minutes long and it is a great addition. Although, I would recommend trying to cut the time in half just because some researchers and students might feel sort of frightened by the video length.

The interactive map can be found by clicking on the [ArcGIS Online!](https://usg.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=9fed23d6e8cb42ccbf4bf6d0a2910fc3) When interacting with this map, you are able to change the year, county lines, and even see the heat maps where the Guerilla violence took place. The map does contain the historical data that Failka has mined and put into his past work, such as his master’s thesis.

The intended audience for this includes history students, professors, and anybody that has a keen knack or hobby for this kind of Civil War stuff. Failka does a good job of presenting a lot of old letters and notes from the past and combining that with maps that show true history. This is intriguing to me and I’m sure to my fellow peers that also may access this website.

This is a Digital Humanities project through and through. Andrew Fialka and his team organize this quite well with the tab section on the left side, the interactive map, and the data talking about Guerilla Violence in the Civil War is remarkable. This project made me a bigger fan of the Civil War in general and really opened my eyes to the violence that struck some of these communities in Missouri.
