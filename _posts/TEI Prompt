# TEI Prompt

### My TEI Coding Experience in XML

For the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) prompt, I was tasked to edit pages 52-55 from the book “The Yellow Wall-paper” written by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. This was written in 1892 by Stetson who struggled with her own mental health issues. In this assignment, I had to analyze Charlotte Stetson’s writing and edit a Google document. Then, I had to insert each paragraph into Oxygen individually with the correct tags.

### Google Doc Markups

To start this excursion, we were each given individually assigned Google Docs that had a few pages of the book. We each marked our own documents with the correct markup. My section included tags like underlining, a weird space, the strikethrough, and as well as the em-dashes. It was nice that 

### Oxygen and XML

The overall look of Oxygen XML is very intimidating. As someone, who sees coding as unchartered territory. It definitely made me a little timid. It was nice to only have to use the text line wrap once at the beginning. The app of Oxygen XML Editor was very easy to navigate when in the system. I really loved the video that Professor Stover posted in the recording section of virtual classes on scholar. After watching it, I think it made the coding easier to bear and more self-explanatory as well. 

It was also nice to have a list of the tags that we needed on the class website. It made coding easier, when I had to perform a markup. I do wish that they would cater a little more towards to the beginner coders. It would be nice to maybe have a little five minute video that explained the basics of Oxygen XML.

I’m grateful for this TEI prompt because it allowed me to step out of my comfort zone in a fun and educating way. I definitely feel more comfortable with coding and wouldn’t mind if we had more opportunities to work with Oxygen. Hopefully I can apply this to any type of work I come across in the future!
