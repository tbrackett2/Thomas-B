### Grant Process and Reflection:

### Grant Review

The grant proposal we set out on was to create a cross-platform social media comparison site that would crunch the numbers for us. We plan on using a software intermediary called Application Programming Interface (API), in order to pull data from a social media site onto another. I have found the social media numbers for G2 Esports, Cloud9, and as well as Team Liquid from their respective platforms. It is actually quite fond to look at these Esports teams and to see the growing community is shocking and awesome at the same time.

Our current project is actually nothing like our abstract submission. We proposed to do a grant proposal about a virtual tour of the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.. My partner and I didn’t realize that we had to submit our own grant idea and not come up with something that hadn’t been created yet. Eric and I are super pumped at where we are currently at in the project stage.

The hardest part for us has actually been to find similar projects. We have not found quite similar Digital Humanities projects online in the form of grants. Although, we have found our grant in the form of other data explanation like YouTube for example.

The process of writing a grant for my English 350 Writing Intensive has been very eventful. My partner Eric and I struggled at first with the submission of our abstract. We have slowly bounced back when working on our Grant Narrative and Environmental Scan. This grant proposal project was definitely daunting when we were first talking about it in class. Although, I have definitely come to a better realization that this project will soon come full circle with all the pieces of the puzzle in place at the final submission. It is definitely hard to see the end goal when you are taking it step by step. I do think the Peer Reviews help tremendously when it comes to revisiting my project to readjust what needs to be fixed.


### Class Reflection

Digital Humanities has a much bigger meaning to me than when I had my first class with Dr. Stover in January. I didn’t have high expectations for this class as it was a filler for my senior writing intensive requirement. My definition of Digital Humanities definitely hasn’t changed, but over time during this semester I have gained a much better appreciation for this field. I didn’t quite grasp the application that this field had on us students, teachers, and any other citizens willing to learn. This isn’t just a study of the humanities, but also an application of digital projects that disseminate information to the public in a fun and interactive way.

I struggled with the research blog assignment that included Oxygen and XML. This was tricky working with a program that I had never laid eyes on before. But, I must tip my cap to the video that you posted with instruction on how to access and work Oxygen/XML editor. I thought the very first research blog assigned was super helpful in understanding the basic concepts and end goal of what a Digital Humanities project is supposed to look like. I really enjoyed how we were allowed to pick our own topic and describe how the project worked.

My partner Eric O’Brien and I have been working on our Grant for a couple weeks now. We definitely have seen some changes to the overall theme of it, as we have focused on narrowing down our Grant from Esports as a whole, to a few specific teams that have multiple different social media platforms. The hardest part for us has been the grant narrative part. It has been hard to find Digital Humanities projects that are relatively similar to the grant we are attempting to propose for a budget.
