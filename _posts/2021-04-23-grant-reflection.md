### Class Reflection

Digital Humanities has a much bigger meaning to me than when I had my first class with Dr. Stover in January. I didn’t have high expectations for this class as it was a filler for my senior writing intensive requirement. My definition of Digital Humanities definitely hasn’t changed, but over time during this semester I have gained a much better appreciation for this field. I didn’t quite grasp the application that this field had on us students, teachers, and any other citizens willing to learn. This isn’t just a study of the humanities, but also an application of digital projects that disseminate information to the public in a fun and interactive way.

I struggled with the research blog assignment that included Oxygen and XML. This was tricky working with a program that I had never laid eyes on before. But, I must tip my cap to the video that you posted with instruction on how to access and work Oxygen/XML editor. I thought the very first research blog assigned was super helpful in understanding the basic concepts and end goal of what a Digital Humanities project is supposed to look like. I really enjoyed how we were allowed to pick our own topic and describe how the project worked.

My partner Eric O’Brien and I have been working on our Grant for a couple weeks now. We definitely have seen some changes to the overall theme of it, as we have focused on narrowing down our Grant from Esports as a whole, to a few specific teams that have multiple different social media platforms. The hardest part for us has been the grant narrative part. It has been hard to find Digital Humanities projects that are relatively similar to the grant we are attempting to propose for a budget.
